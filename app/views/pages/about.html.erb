        <p>I'm from France and currently based in Berlin. I have worked in various start-ups in Paris and Berlin (Too Good To Go, Foodora), occupying different positions in Sales and Success. Working closely with the Tech team made me want to learn more, so I decided to attend <b>the Wagon bootcamp</b>. Now I have a great interest in code and want to deepen my knowledge by practicing!</p>

      <H1>SKILLS</H1>
      <p>Apart from coding, I have strong experience in processes automation and optimization, using (a lot) Excel and Zapier for example. I worked for years as Account Manager, and also have sales skills. My greatest strength is that I communicate a lot. This makes it easy to resolve conflicts when they arise, but also to have fun while working! I'm a good problem solver.</p>

      <H1>LANGUAGES</H1>
      <p>Iâ€™m currently working to improve my skills on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - but I'm also learning German and Portuguese! I would love to work for projects with social and/or environmental impact.</p>

      <H1>MORE ABOUT ME</H1>
      <p>... I love to learn new stuff in general. I think I can be defined as a hedonist, I like to spend time in the nature as much as I like to spend time in bars with friends. I listen to a lot of music (here is my Soundcloud) and I do sports like yoga, contemporary dance, hiking. I travel quite a bit.</p>
